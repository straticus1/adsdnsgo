This is the repo for "adsdnsgo" "After Dark Systems DNS GO!"

Goals:

- Ultra fast DNS Query engine
- Ultra Fast DNS SEC Validator
- Ultra Fast DNS Records validator
- Full integration into dnsscience.io API
- Support config file in JSON
- Support all the features of "dig" and "drill"
- I think a newly designed dns CLI that is something like:

dnsgo query <item> <query-type> <level>
dnsgo debug <options>
dnsgo mkpacket <dns-packet> <value>
dnsgo makekey 
dnsgo txt <host> validate
dnsgo spf make <host>
dnsgo spf get <host>
dnsgo dmarc get or show <host>
dnsgo appliance set <ibx|bluecat> <url> <key<
dnsgo validate <type> <platform>
dnsgo science <dnsscience> <platform> <features> <host or url>

platform = ibx,bluecat,djbdns,bind,powerdns,unbound,nsd
validate supports type = <dir> or <file>

appliance set or get for infoblox or bluecat API Support
dnsscience = dnsscience integration, require "dnsscience key set <json-key-file>"

dmarc = make or show dmarc records
txt = check text records, valid
makekey = make dnssec key pair
mkpacket = make dns packet ypes with specified value
debug = dns debugging features
query type = Queries are all|a|cname|txt|ns|ptr|soa|dnskey}tsig whatever-i-forgot
level = short|long|detail|verbose|debug
